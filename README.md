# 30 days of ML

## Plan: implement 5 canonical papers that are foundations of modern DL 

### Paper 1: Backprop by Hinton (March 20)

Concept: Backprop & Autograd\
Link: https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/ift3395/lectures/backprop_old.pdf\
Implementation: MLP trained on MNIST dataset using backprop & vanilla grad descent

### Paper 2: ResNet (March 27)

Concept: Convolution & residual networks\
Link: \
Implementation: 

### Paper 3: Transformers (April 4)

Concept: Attention\
Link:\
Implementation:

### Paper 4: GAN (April 11)

Concept: Discriminators\
Link:\
Implementation:

### Paper 5: Diffusion (April 18)

Concept: Diffusion models\
Link:\
Implementation:

### NOTES

Link & Implementation will be filled in as I progress.\

I am not so set on paper 5. I may swap it out for a RL paper, given that training a diffusion model is not feasible and I will be only implementing forward prop. I may do both: impl of Diffusion inference, impl of RL training + infernece.
